There are several options for installing selfoss:

* The [basic installation](@/docs/administration/installation/basic.md) of simply extracting selfoss archive to your web server is great for beginners.
    * There are also more detailed guides for specific platforms provided by the community on the [wiki](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/wiki#installation-instructions).
* Installing [declaratively on NixOS](https://github.com/fossar/selfoss/wiki/Declarative-installation-on-NixOS).
* Running selfoss inside a Docker container using an [unofficial Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/rsprta/selfoss).
